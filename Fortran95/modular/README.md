this is the best way to code in fortran. all the functionality is in subroutines, and they are encapsulated in a module in the same file. the reading can occur directly from the matrix format but a drawback is that the dimensions of the matrix have to be hardcoded. other than that, this code is perfect, and inline with my philosophy of only passing paths and numbers to arrays while everything else to be read from files.
